# Data Analysis with Python: Zero to Pandas

This repository contains the Python scripts and projects I created while learning the *Data Analysis with Python: Zero to Pandas* course. The course covers essential topics in data analysis using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

### Key Topics Covered:
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, transforming columns, and filtering data.
- **Data Wrangling**: Merging, reshaping, and aggregating data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing datasets with statistics and visualizations.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating insightful plots using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

Each file in this repository represents a lesson or exercise from the course, providing hands-on examples of how to analyze real-world datasets.
